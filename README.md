# Worm YOLOv3
An implementation of [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf) to locate and track ***C. elegans*** from experiment videos generated by the [WormBot](https://github.com/JasonNPitt/wormbot). Tracked locations are then used to make **time of death calls** and other biologically relevant metrics.

##  Pipeline
1. Videos exported from the experiment.

2. Bounding box detections are made from the videos.
<!-- 3. ![Processed](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1yIYDmaFXVnej_rslTmtlnQ9hPwHkFc7T) -->
3. Death calls are made using the detections.

## Requirements

Python 3.7 or later with all `requirements.txt` dependencies installed, including `torch >= 1.5`. To install run:
```bash
$ pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use
* download weights from google drive link in weights folder
* look at "simple_test.ipynb" to test if all dependencies are installed correctly and to see the simplest way to pass the model on images is
* note: classes.names is in cfg folder

* using csv and img options:
-- $ python3 yolov3_tracker_latest.py -h
the only arguments that you should have to set are: weights, out_path, data_path, video, csv, img
-- note: currently video doesn't work
* example
if you wanted to generate csv file from the images you'd run:
-- $ python3 yolov3_tracker_latest.py --weights %path_to_weights% --out_path %save_folder% --data_path %images_folder% --csv
* if you also wanted to generate anotated png files you would add --img to the end.


## Data Info
* approximately 1068 images 1080x1920
* 56,047 individual worms
* --csv tag saves 1 csv per image in the format: img_name, x1, y1, w, h
